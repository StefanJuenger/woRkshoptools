# woRkshoptools

[`woRkshoptools`](https://stefanjuenger.github.io/woRkshoptools) is an `R`-package aimed at making our lives a bit easier when preparing our GESIS workshops. It's currently under heavy development, and the documentation is lacking some serious content.

You can try to install it using this command in `R`:

```
if (!require(devtools)) { install("devtools" }
devtools::install_github("StefanJuenger/woRkshoptools")
```
